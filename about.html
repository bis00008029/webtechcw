                    The story of our website isn't too long, it was literally 
                    created in several hours! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The hardest part in creating of this website was choosing 
                    it's name and design. Though one of the ideas was to 
                    make a logo with a doggon on it, but there are so many of 
                    them and it's really hard to choose!
                </p>
                <figure class="about-figure">
                    <img class="about-img" src="images/dogs-age-years-kb-inline-200707-1587661.jpg">
                    <figcaption>So many doggos, which to choose?</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    But eventually Shiba Inu picture came out of nowhere and 
                    then it was decided, which good boy is going to be the face
                    and name for the website.
                </p>

                    <figcaption>Just look at the smile</figcaption>
                </figure>

                    So if you ever need to ask a question come to our website,
                    but even if you don't, you can always come to this page and
                    look on the doggos!
